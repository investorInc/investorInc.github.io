  "about": "Passive vs. Active Investing is a hotly debated topic in the world of finance. Passive investing involves investing in index funds or ETFs that track the overall market, while active investing involves stock picking and portfolio management in an attempt to outperform the market. Both strategies have their pros and cons, and the decision ultimately comes down to your financial goals and risk tolerance. Passive investing is often favored for its lower fees and more consistent returns, while active investing can potentially yield higher returns but also comes with higher risk and fees. At InvestBread.com, we provide resources and information to help you make informed investment decisions and create a portfolio that aligns with your financial goals."
