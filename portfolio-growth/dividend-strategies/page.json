  "about": "Dividend strategies are an investment approach aiming to generate passive income through dividend paying stocks. Dividend paying stocks are stocks that share a portion of their profits with shareholders in the form of dividends. When investing in dividend paying stocks, an investor seeks to hold stocks with a history of paying dividends and increasing the payout over time. There are different dividend strategies based on the type of dividend paying stocks and the desired yield. High-yield investing is a dividend strategy aimed at generating higher income by investing in stocks with high yields, typically above the market average. There are also dividend-oriented mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in dividend-paying stocks. The choice of dividend strategy depends on the investor's financial goals, risk appetite, and investment horizon."
